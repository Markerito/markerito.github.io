        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third-year at the University of California, Riverside.<br><br>

        I was born and raised in the Coachella Valley. I am currently finishing up my bachelors degree with a minor in public policy. After graduating, I plan on pursuing a masters in special education for children with mild to moderate disabilities. My love of knowledge, coupled with my ability to work with neuro divergencies, is going to propel me far in my dream of becoming a teacher. However, I do not plan to stay a teacher for the rest of my career. Growing up in a low-income community, predominantly migrant farm workers, I am no stranger to injustice. As a child, I attempted to right everything I perceived as wrong. I had a very strong moral standing, and I let it be known. It started with me, looking at ways to better my parents living situation. This typically consisted of researching, understanding, and interpreting certain policies and jargon. All of this has continued to fuel my love of righting societal wrongs. Even as an adult, I look for ways to amplify my advocacy beyond social media. I am part of my universityâ€™s Legislative Advocacy Committee in hopes of learning how to properly advocate for underserved individuals. We are taught how to address politicians, present our arguments, and seek consensus. All of this has made it more evident than ever that my true calling is advocacy.<br><br>

        After having built a solid foundation in teaching, I plan on focusing my energy on addressing mild to moderate disability from a legislative standpoint. With my bachelor's in political science / minor in public policy and Masterâ€™s in Special Education, I plan on pursuing a master's in public policy. I am hoping to take my knowledge and apply it in any way I can. Surely, I hope to be able to advocate at the federal level. I would like to take my research capabilities to think and other education organizations to help create policies that would benefit students of all calibers. My dream job would be to work for the National Education Association (NEA). I would love to write articles, help evaluate policies, and propose alternative solutions to problems that we face in the K2 setting. Ultimately, I hope to make life better, not just for students I work with directly at my teaching job but also nationwide as I push for a more accessible curriculum. I genuinely love working with children. Discovering ways to introduce new concepts and seeing the lightbulb click is a feeling I cannot replicate elsewhere. This feeling stems from my lifelong love of educators. They have shaped my life in the most positive ways possible. Just about every major decision in my life has been influenced by the ways my teachers and professors engaged with me. All of this, I believe, has adequately prepared me for a role as a special education teacher and, eventually, a policy analyzer and advocate. I look forward to shaping the minds of young children as well as a positive influence in their life in manners of IEP.
